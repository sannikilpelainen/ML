# ML project: Predicting whether a mosquito is hungry
## About this project
This project intended to find a way to predict whether a mosquito is willing to bite a human. As mosquitoes are tiny creatures, the most notable thing for us humans is probably the annoying sound they make when flying. Therefore, this project tried to predict whether a mosquito is hungry based solely on its sound. Since the label is binary (hungry, not hungry), logistic regression was used as the main ML method.
## Data
All the data used in this project is from HumBugDB: A Large-scale Acoustic Mosquito Dataset from the Zenodo website (https://zenodo.org/records/4904800). The data contains 4 different folders of audio recordings of mosquitoes and one CSV file containing information about the mosquitoes.
